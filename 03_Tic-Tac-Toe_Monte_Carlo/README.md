# Tic-Tac-Toe (Monte Carlo)

This was my Tic-Tac-Toe (Monte Carlo) submission for Coursera's Principles of Computing course. It uses the [Monte Carlo method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) to decide which square the computer is going to select on its turn.

## How to Play

(TL;DR - Click the play button in the upper left [here](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user41_xE9D7UkJqq_8.py).)

![Hit that play button in the upper left](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user41_88QREbv1Qi_0.py)

Currently, this code is intended for use with Coursera's [Codeskulptor](http://www.codeskulptor.org/) Python interpreter, and you can play my version [here](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user41_88QREbv1Qi_0.py). You just have to hit the "play" icon in the upper left corner.

After hitting play, the computer will start a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. You will not beat it. At best you'll get a tie.
