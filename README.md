# An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python

This repository houses my projects for both parts of Coursera's course [Principles of Computing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/principles-of-computing-1) created by Rice University. This course aims to expand on the programming skills taught in their course Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python with important programming practices and mathematical problem solving skills. It was a pretty fun course and all of the projects are games that you checkout and play in your browser.

## Playing the games

Go to any folder in this repository, click the link to the project in that folder's README, and click the "Play" button in the upper left corner on the projects Codeskulptor page.  It'll look like this:

## More Info About the Course

### Codeskulptor

For this course one of the professors at Rice University created an in-browser IDE called [Codeskulptor](http://www.codeskulptor.org/).

### SimpleGUI for Creating Frames and GUIs

Since we're using an in-browser IDE, the good professors at Rice created SimpleGUI, which is a graphical module akin to TkInter but for the browser as a platform.
