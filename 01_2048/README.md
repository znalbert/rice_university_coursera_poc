# 2048

This was my 2048 submission for Coursera's Principles of Computing course. You have to try to match like numbers by sliding the tiles using the arrow keys. Every time two are matched they merge and the number is doubled. The goal is to keep doubling until one tile equals 2048.

## How to Play

(TL;DR - Click the play button in the upper left [here](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user41_xE9D7UkJqq_8.py).)

Currently, this code is intended for use with Coursera's [Codeskulptor](http://www.codeskulptor.org/) Python interpreter, and you can play my version [here](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user41_xE9D7UkJqq_8.py). You just have to hit the "play" icon in the upper left corner.

After hitting play, just start sliding the tiles to combine them with the arrow keys. Also, be wary of the passage of time, because if you're at all like me you can play this game for hours.

## Learning Objectives for This Project

#### Coding Style, Testing, Plotting, and Grids

This was actually a two week project. The first week's was just the logic governing the merging of two numbers/tiles with a focus on good coding style as checked by Pylint. The second week, we were to test our functions in order to ensure that they'd work before getting them to work with the GUI grid system we used.
